# COVID-19 Analysis 
### Study Case
COVID-19 has impacted Indonesia since it was first reported in March 2020. Since then, Indonesia has experienced different waves of cases, with severe spikes in cases during certain periods. The Indonesian government has implemented various measures to address the pandemic, including social restrictions, mass vaccination campaigns, and public awareness campaigns. However, significant challenges remain in controlling the spread of the virus across the country.
In this project, the analysis will focus on the development of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia from March 1, 2020, to September 16, 2022, to provide insights needed by the health data and technology team.
### Objective
To find:
1. The total number of new active Covid-19 cases in each province, starting from the largest.
2. Selecting two location ISO codes with the least total deaths due to Covid-19.
3. Dates when the recovery rate of Covid-19 cases in Indonesia was highest, along with the corresponding rates.
4. Total case fatality rate and case recovery rate for each location ISO code, sorted from the lowest data.
5. Dates when the total number of Covid-19 cases first reached the tens of thousands.
6. Number of recorded data when Covid-19 cases were greater than or equal to 30,000.
### The Tools
